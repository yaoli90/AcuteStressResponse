# AcuteStressResponse 
## Dataset
The Fight-or-flight EEG response dataset is collected from 5 subjects
(age 24-30) in 4 runs. The EEG channels are FP1, FP2, F3, F4, T3, and T4 as
documented in `channel.csv`. Each run contains 59 seconds of the EEG recording.
The first 50 seconds are collected when subjects are working on an
manufacturing task with the robot. The robot failure starts at the start of the
51-second and the rest 9 seconds contains the fight-or-flight response. The
label of the fight-or-flight response can be found in  `label.csv`.
